00:00:07,579 --> 00:00:10,397
Hello and welcome to
Microsoft Azure Words of the Day

2
00:00:10,422 --> 00:00:13,356
this is the show that teaches
you the Azure vocabulary!

3
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:17,521
An App Service is a web server
running as a service in Microsoft Azure.

4
00:00:17,546 --> 00:00:20,252
So you can run HTTP based applications

5
00:00:20,277 --> 00:00:24,776
for example a mobile backend,
a web API, a website etc.

6
00:00:24,895 --> 00:00:27,577
The really cool thing is that
you can choose between Windows

7
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:30,879
and Linux as your operating
system, so you have a choice.

8
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:34,680
And you can deploy your code,
either in a Docker based container

9
00:00:34,728 --> 00:00:36,640
or directly from Github,

10
00:00:36,665 --> 00:00:40,547
from other repositories or from a
continuous deployment solution.

11
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,088
Around App Services,
you can also configure a lot of features

12
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:46,738
for example different
deployment solutions,

13
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:49,063
Authorization and
Authentication,

14
00:00:49,194 --> 00:00:53,170
Identity, Backups,
Custom domains,

15
00:00:53,275 --> 00:00:56,529
TLS and SSL to enable
HTTPS,

16
00:00:56,767 --> 00:00:59,583
you can also automatically
scale up and scale down

17
00:00:59,672 --> 00:01:02,915
for example to respond to a
lot of demand very fast.

18
00:01:03,151 --> 00:01:04,801
Let's check the application

19
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:07,738
now this here is an
ASP.NET Core application

20
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:11,518
running a React.JS front end,
but App Services also support

21
00:01:11,543 --> 00:01:17,682
classic .NET, Java,
Node.js, Ruby, Python, PHP,

22
00:01:17,707 --> 00:01:19,898
so you have a choice
for your framework.

23
00:01:20,098 --> 00:01:23,540
In the Azure portal you can check
the health of your app service,

24
00:01:23,565 --> 00:01:28,214
and there is also Application Insights
which is a very rich monitoring solution.

25
00:01:28,369 --> 00:01:32,261
If I scroll down further we can
see more monitoring solutions,

26
00:01:32,347 --> 00:01:34,943
for example the Log Stream
which allows me to see

27
00:01:34,968 --> 00:01:38,060
what is happening in my
application in real time

28
00:01:38,085 --> 00:01:41,258
That's quite handy to avoid
having to download the logs.

29
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:44,154
App Services have a lot of
additional functionalities,

30
00:01:44,179 --> 00:01:47,107
so make sure to check the links
here to know more about that

31
00:01:47,332 --> 00:01:50,586
Thank you so much for watching
Microsoft Azure Words of the Day

32
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:53,475
Today's words of the
day were: App Service.
