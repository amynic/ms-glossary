Hello and welcome to Microsoft
Azure Words of the Day

2
00:00:09,857 --> 00:00:13,041
this is the show that teaches
you the Azure vocabulary!

3
00:00:13,488 --> 00:00:16,637
AAD is short for Azure
Active Directory.

4
00:00:16,708 --> 00:00:21,206
It is a fundamental component of
Azure and it has to do with security,

5
00:00:21,255 --> 00:00:24,617
more specifically with identity
and access management.

6
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:30,368
It's sometimes called IDaaS,
or Identity as a service.

7
00:00:30,581 --> 00:00:34,774
AAD has wide applications to
identify and authorize people,

8
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:38,910
inside Azure of course but also
inside your own organization.

9
00:00:39,029 --> 00:00:42,256
It can also be used to manage
the identity of your users

10
00:00:42,324 --> 00:00:44,537
for third party
cloud applications,

11
00:00:44,632 --> 00:00:47,464
or even to manage the
identity of your customers.

12
00:00:47,853 --> 00:00:50,083
There are different
editions of AAD,

13
00:00:50,155 --> 00:00:53,094
Free, Basic and Premium.

14
00:00:53,301 --> 00:00:58,210
Each edition has specific features, so
make sure to check the documentation here.

15
00:00:58,235 --> 00:01:01,451
You can integrate with
AAD at multiple levels:

16
00:01:01,476 --> 00:01:03,290
In the Microsoft cloud,

17
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:08,219
with Microsoft 365 or any of our
Platform as a Service offerings.

18
00:01:08,376 --> 00:01:12,175
In Windows 10 to join a
device to an organization, etc.

19
00:01:12,357 --> 00:01:17,810
It can also handle single
sign-on, B2C, B2B and more.

20
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:21,677
It's easy to use multi-factor
authentication with AAD.

21
00:01:21,702 --> 00:01:25,264
For example by using the
Microsoft Authenticator app,

22
00:01:25,289 --> 00:01:27,622
this is how I can use my
fingerprint to confirm

23
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:30,109
that I want to log into
a Microsoft domain,

24
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,033
for example the Azure Portal.

25
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:36,340
Of course this also works for a wide
range of sites and applications.

26
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:39,447
Azure Active Directory has
a lot of great features

27
00:01:39,546 --> 00:01:43,424
and it makes setting up identity services
much easier than it used to be.

28
00:01:43,532 --> 00:01:46,851
So make sure to check all the
links that we assembled for you here!

29
00:01:46,987 --> 00:01:50,280
Thank you so much for watching
Microsoft Azure Words of the Day.

30
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,406
Today's word of
the day was: AAD.
