Hello and welcome to Microsoft
Azure Words of the Day

2
00:00:10,548 --> 00:00:13,675
this is the show that teaches
you the Azure vocabulary!

3
00:00:13,903 --> 00:00:16,845
Serverless means that your
code runs on a server,

4
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:19,806
but you don't have to worry about it.
It is abstracted.

5
00:00:19,831 --> 00:00:24,799
As a developer, you can concentrate on writing
the code, testing it and deploying it.

6
00:00:24,823 --> 00:00:26,823
Several features are automated:

7
00:00:26,847 --> 00:00:31,913
Starting the application, listening to
events to start the execution of the code,

8
00:00:31,938 --> 00:00:35,493
 scaling up and down
when the demand fluctuates, etc.

9
00:00:35,517 --> 00:00:40,767
Typically serverless solutions are paid by
the execution time, in a consumption model.

10
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:45,604
Most cloud providers offer free tiers with
which you can run a serverless application

11
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:50,414
for a certain amount of time, or a
certain amount of executions, for free.

12
00:00:50,683 --> 00:00:53,184
On Microsoft Azure,
there are quite a few solutions

13
00:00:53,209 --> 00:00:55,783
that you can use to run your
code in a serverless manner,

14
00:00:55,808 --> 00:01:01,408
for example Azure Functions, Logic
Apps, SignalR as a service, etc etc

15
00:01:01,678 --> 00:01:04,747
Here is one example of
serverless application on Azure:

16
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:09,600
In an Azure Function, you start the execution
of your code by observing some triggers.

17
00:01:09,706 --> 00:01:11,747
There are a number of trigger
types, for example

18
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:15,344
HTTP triggers to respond
to an HTTP request;

19
00:01:15,369 --> 00:01:18,430
timer trigger to execute
code on a schedule;

20
00:01:18,455 --> 00:01:22,719
event grid triggers to answer to events
happening in another Azure service;

21
00:01:22,744 --> 00:01:27,061
Cosmos DB trigger to execute code
when something changes in a database;

22
00:01:27,086 --> 00:01:28,159
and many more.

23
00:01:28,184 --> 00:01:30,663
Or another example of
serverless application:

24
00:01:30,688 --> 00:01:34,207
A Logic App also starts its
execution when an event happens.

25
00:01:34,299 --> 00:01:35,812
There are many
sources of events,

26
00:01:35,837 --> 00:01:39,268
for example when you receive
an email in Outlook or Gmail,

27
00:01:39,293 --> 00:01:44,246
when a document is modified in Office
365, and many many many more.

28
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:46,022
One really nice
feature of serverless

29
00:01:46,047 --> 00:01:49,493
is that your application will
automatically scale up and down.

30
00:01:49,518 --> 00:01:52,123
Here we see how an Azure
Function application is

31
00:01:52,148 --> 00:01:54,973
automatically scaling
up to additional servers

32
00:01:54,998 --> 00:01:57,966
This way you are covered,
if a lot of people like your product,

33
00:01:57,991 --> 00:02:00,929
we will provide additional
servers to cover the demand.

34
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:03,931
And since you only pay for
what you actually consume,

35
00:02:03,956 --> 00:02:06,911
serverless solutions end up
being quite cost effective.

36
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:09,269
There are more serverless
solutions on Azure,

37
00:02:09,294 --> 00:02:12,602
so don't forget to check the links
here in order to know more about that.

38
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,948
Thank you so much for watching
Microsoft Azure Words of the Day.

39
00:02:15,973 --> 00:02:18,527
Today's word of the
day was: Serverless.
