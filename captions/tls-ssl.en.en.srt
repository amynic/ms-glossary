00:00:07,633 --> 00:00:10,422
Hello and welcome to Microsoft
Azure Words of the Day,

2
00:00:10,476 --> 00:00:13,394
the show that teaches
you the Azure vocabulary!

3
00:00:13,631 --> 00:00:17,331
TLS is short for
Transport Layer Security

4
00:00:17,421 --> 00:00:20,765
SSL is short for
Secure Sockets Layer.

5
00:00:20,885 --> 00:00:26,063
SSL is a standard that enables secure,
encrypted transmissions over the internet.

6
00:00:26,244 --> 00:00:30,133
It requires a certificate that you
can purchase from various vendors.

7
00:00:30,264 --> 00:00:35,136
TLS is similar to SSL but it is a
newer, more modern version.

8
00:00:35,266 --> 00:00:37,498
It also relies on certificates,

9
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,976
in fact when you purchase an SSL certificate,
it is often already ready for TLS.

10
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:46,773
When TLS or SSL are
setup on your web server,

11
00:00:46,852 --> 00:00:50,880
this enables you to serve
web content over HTTPS.

12
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:55,575
This other abbreviation means:
Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure.

13
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:58,424
But just like HTTP
is not just for text,

14
00:00:58,465 --> 00:01:01,432
HTTPS is encrypting the
whole communication.

15
00:01:01,563 --> 00:01:07,327
HTTPS is often used in the web browser,
but it can also be used for APIs, etc.

16
00:01:07,351 --> 00:01:09,715
In the Azure portal,
you can easily buy

17
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:13,140
or import a certificate to
secure your App Service.

18
00:01:13,244 --> 00:01:17,311
Note however that web applications
on Azure are secure by default.

19
00:01:17,482 --> 00:01:20,647
This is why you see
HTTPS in the location bar

20
00:01:20,672 --> 00:01:25,292
when you navigate to any website
on anything.azurewebsites.net,

21
00:01:25,346 --> 00:01:29,394
which is the default address for
App Services, Azure Functions, etc.

22
00:01:29,446 --> 00:01:34,297
The certificate and the HTTPS settings are
needed when you want to use a custom domain,

23
00:01:34,368 --> 00:01:36,273
for example TailwindTraders.com.

24
00:01:36,334 --> 00:01:38,785
When navigating
to an HTTPS site,

25
00:01:38,815 --> 00:01:42,009
you can see more information
about the certificate here.

26
00:01:42,061 --> 00:01:47,001
This shows a valid certificate used on
a custom domain, it's safe to browse it.

27
00:01:47,092 --> 00:01:51,130
You can sometimes choose
between HTTP or HTTPS.

28
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:56,033
Here we see a note in the web browser
indicating that this connection is not secure.

29
00:01:56,253 --> 00:02:00,519
It is recommended to always require
HTTPS on your web application.

30
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:03,537
In Azure, you can set it
up with this switch here.

31
00:02:03,795 --> 00:02:05,602
Security is a complex topic,

32
00:02:05,627 --> 00:02:09,078
and we definitely need more than
just two minutes to talk about it.

33
00:02:09,134 --> 00:02:11,584
So check the links here
to learn more about that.

34
00:02:11,793 --> 00:02:14,909
Thank you so much for watching
Microsoft Azure Words of the Day.

35
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:18,630
Today's abbreviations of
the day were: TLS / SSL.
