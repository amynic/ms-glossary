00:00:00,589 --> 00:00:03,413
Hello and welcome to Microsoft
Azure Words of the Day

2
00:00:03,438 --> 00:00:06,293
the show that teaches
you Azure vocabulary!

3
00:00:07,018 --> 00:00:11,168
Today's word of the day
is an abbreviation: AAD

4
00:00:13,884 --> 00:00:17,523
AAD is short for Azure
Active Directory.

5
00:00:17,623 --> 00:00:21,773
It is a fundamental component of
Azure and has to do with security,

6
00:00:21,798 --> 00:00:25,013
more specifically identity
and access management.

7
00:00:25,265 --> 00:00:30,764
It's sometimes called IDaaS,
or Identity as a service.

8
00:00:30,977 --> 00:00:34,911
AAD has wide applications to
identify and authorize people,

9
00:00:34,936 --> 00:00:38,787
inside Azure of course but also
inside your own organization.

10
00:00:39,084 --> 00:00:42,652
It can also be used to manage
the identity of your users

11
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,114
for third party
cloud applications,

12
00:00:45,139 --> 00:00:48,387
or even to manage the
identity of your customers.

13
00:00:48,561 --> 00:00:50,840
There are different
editions of AAD,

14
00:00:50,865 --> 00:00:53,490
Free, Basic and Premium.

15
00:00:53,697 --> 00:00:58,606
Each edition has specific features, so
make sure to check the documentation here.

16
00:00:58,631 --> 00:01:01,847
You can integrate with
AAD at multiple levels:

17
00:01:02,008 --> 00:01:03,686
In the Microsoft cloud,

18
00:01:03,729 --> 00:01:08,615
in Microsoft 365 or any of our
Platform as a Service offerings.

19
00:01:08,772 --> 00:01:12,853
In Windows 10 to join a
device to an organization, etc.

20
00:01:13,497 --> 00:01:19,291
It can also handle single
sign-on, B2C, B2B and more.

21
00:01:19,516 --> 00:01:23,246
It's easy to use multi-factor
authentication with AAD.

22
00:01:23,402 --> 00:01:26,940
For example by using the
Microsoft Authenticator app,

23
00:01:27,062 --> 00:01:29,656
this is how I can use my
fingerprint to confirm

24
00:01:29,681 --> 00:01:32,140
that I want to log into
a Microsoft domain,

25
00:01:32,252 --> 00:01:34,112
for example the Azure Portal.

26
00:01:34,529 --> 00:01:38,860
Of course this also works for a wide
range of sites and applications.

27
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:42,214
Azure Active Directory has
a lot of great features

28
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:46,577
and it makes setting up identity services
much easier than it used to be.

29
00:01:46,611 --> 00:01:49,930
So make sure to check all the
links we assembled for you here!

30
00:01:49,955 --> 00:01:53,602
Thank you so much for watching
Microsoft Azure Words of the Day.

31
00:01:53,627 --> 00:01:56,723
Today's abbreviation of
the day was: AAD.
