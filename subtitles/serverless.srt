Hello and welcome to Microsoft
Azure Words of the Day

2
00:00:03,383 --> 00:00:06,129
this is the show that teaches
you Azure vocabulary!

3
00:00:07,247 --> 00:00:10,138
Today's word of the day is: Serverless

4
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:15,735
Serverless means that your
code is running on a server,

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,442
but you don't have to worry about
that server. It is abstracted.

6
00:00:19,612 --> 00:00:24,020
On Microsoft Azure, there are a few solutions
to run services in a serverless manner,

7
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:29,697
for example Azure Functions, Logic
Apps, SignalR as a service, etc etc

8
00:00:29,959 --> 00:00:32,300
In an Azure Function,
you can start the execution

9
00:00:32,325 --> 00:00:34,752
of your code by
observing some triggers.

10
00:00:35,013 --> 00:00:37,402
There are a number of trigger
types, for example

11
00:00:37,427 --> 00:00:40,748
HTTP triggers to respond
to an HTTP request;

12
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,069
timer trigger to execute
code on a schedule;

13
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,318
event grid triggers to answer to events
happening in another Azure service;

14
00:00:48,407 --> 00:00:52,758
Cosmos DB trigger to execute code
when something changes in a database;

15
00:00:52,826 --> 00:00:54,153
and many more.

16
00:00:54,366 --> 00:00:58,955
Azure Functions also have bindings,
which allow them to input and output values

17
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,007
from and to different sources.

18
00:01:01,064 --> 00:01:05,248
Don't forget to check the documentation
here to get more information about that!

19
00:01:05,404 --> 00:01:09,067
A Logic App also starts its
execution when an event happens.

20
00:01:09,234 --> 00:01:10,513
There are many
sources of events,

21
00:01:10,538 --> 00:01:13,756
for example when you receive
an email in Outlook or Gmail,

22
00:01:13,781 --> 00:01:18,734
when a document is modified in Office
365, and many many many more.

23
00:01:19,039 --> 00:01:21,134
One really nice
feature of serverless

24
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:24,605
is that your application will
automatically scale up and down.

25
00:01:24,705 --> 00:01:27,310
Here we see how an Azure
Function application is

26
00:01:27,335 --> 00:01:30,532
automatically scaling
up to additional servers

27
00:01:30,587 --> 00:01:32,333
when a lot of requests arrive.

28
00:01:32,523 --> 00:01:35,686
This way you are covered,
if a lot of people like your product,

29
00:01:35,711 --> 00:01:38,477
we will provide additional
servers to cover the demand.

30
00:01:38,668 --> 00:01:41,819
And since you only pay for
what you actually consume,

31
00:01:41,844 --> 00:01:44,799
serverless solutions end up
being quite cost effective.

32
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,733
There are more serverless
services on Azure,

33
00:01:47,758 --> 00:01:50,727
so don't forget to check the links
here to know more about that.

34
00:01:50,851 --> 00:01:54,238
Thank you so much for watching
Microsoft Azure Words of the Day.

35
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:56,993
Today's word
of the day was: Serverless.
