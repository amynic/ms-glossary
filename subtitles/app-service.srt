00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:03,357
Hello and welcome to
Microsoft Azure Words of the Day

2
00:00:03,382 --> 00:00:06,340
this is the show that
teaches you Azure vocabulary!

3
00:00:07,244 --> 00:00:10,394
Today's words of the day are: App Service

4
00:00:13,506 --> 00:00:17,704
An App Service is a web server
running as a service on Azure.

5
00:00:17,792 --> 00:00:22,361
So you can run web based applications,
that means HTTP based applications

6
00:00:22,386 --> 00:00:26,450
for example a mobile backend,
a website, a web API etc.

7
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,927
The really cool thing is that
you can choose Windows

8
00:00:28,952 --> 00:00:31,793
or Linux as your operating
system, so you have a choice.

9
00:00:31,961 --> 00:00:35,453
And you can deploy your code,
either in a Docker container

10
00:00:35,548 --> 00:00:38,111
or directly from a
Github repository,

11
00:00:38,136 --> 00:00:42,018
other repositories or from a
continuous deployment solution.

12
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:45,313
Around App Services,
you can also configure a lot of features

13
00:00:45,338 --> 00:00:47,752
for example different
deployment solutions,

14
00:00:47,918 --> 00:00:50,013
Authorization and
Authentication,

15
00:00:50,038 --> 00:00:53,873
Identity, Backups,
Custom domains,

16
00:00:53,945 --> 00:00:56,921
TLS and SSL to enable
HTTPS,

17
00:00:57,112 --> 00:00:59,928
you can also automatically
scale up and scale down

18
00:00:59,953 --> 00:01:03,196
for example to respond to a
lot of demand very fast.

19
00:01:03,444 --> 00:01:05,293
Let's check the application

20
00:01:05,318 --> 00:01:08,056
now this here is an
ASP.NET Core application

21
00:01:08,081 --> 00:01:11,969
running a React.JS front end,
but App Services also support

22
00:01:11,994 --> 00:01:18,148
classic .NET, Java,
Node.js, Ruby, Python, PHP,

23
00:01:18,173 --> 00:01:20,364
so you have a choice
for your framework.

24
00:01:20,514 --> 00:01:24,205
In the Azure portal you can check
the health of your app service,

25
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:28,586
and there is also Application Insights
which is a very rich monitoring solution.

26
00:01:28,912 --> 00:01:32,547
If I scroll down further we can
see more monitoring solutions,

27
00:01:32,572 --> 00:01:35,278
for example the Log Stream
which allows me to see

28
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:38,395
what is happening in my
application in real time

29
00:01:38,462 --> 00:01:41,415
That's quite handy to avoid
having to download the logs.

30
00:01:41,588 --> 00:01:44,008
App Services have a lot of
additional functionalities,

31
00:01:44,033 --> 00:01:46,262
so don't forget to
check the links here

32
00:01:46,287 --> 00:01:47,914
in order to know
more about that.

33
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:51,295
Thank you so much for watching
Microsoft Azure Words of the Day

34
00:01:51,334 --> 00:01:54,198
Today's words of the
day were: App Service.
