# Microsoft Azure Words of the Day

Thanks for your interest in our work.

Azure Words of the Day is designed to be a reference site for learners, and compile a list of words, expressions and abbreviations related to Microsoft Azure, with their definition and explanations.

Each word, expression or abbreviation will be illustrated by a short video explaining the concept. Items will be cross-referenced, a little like Wikipedia does. In addition, we also list links to documentation and Microsoft Learn. 

## We welcome your contributions!!

You can contribute to this site in two areas:

### Submitting a translation for subtitles

You can help us!! Are you fluent in another language than English? We can definitely use your help for translations! 

[Get started here](instructions/contributing-subtitles.md)

### Submitting a synopsis for a new topic for Words of the Day

This is where you can submit proposals for a new topic. You can also find other synopsis for topics already created, and inspire yourself for your own contributions!

> Note: During the launch phase, we will only accept contributions from the Microsoft Cloud Advocacy team but as soon as we can, we will accept contributions from other Microsoft employees and from partners too :)
