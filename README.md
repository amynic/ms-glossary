# Microsoft Azure Words of the Day

Thanks for your interest in our work.

Azure Words of the Day is designed to be a reference site for learners, and compile a list of words, expressions and abbreviations related to Microsoft Azure, with their definition and explanations.

Each word, expression or abbreviation will be illustrated by a short video explaining the concept. Items will be cross-referenced, a little like Wikipedia does. In addition, we also list links to documentation and Microsoft Learn.
