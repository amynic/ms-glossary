# Microsoft Glossary Pilot Phase

![We need you](./images/WeNeedYou.jpg)

Thanks for your interest in helping [the Microsoft Glossary](http://gslb.ch/gloss) to grow. This is a new Docs section dedicated to definitions of Microsoft (or general tech) related terms. The hardest part when learning a technology is to understand the "dialect" and all the terms. The Microsoft Glossary is helping with this issue. It's also a great opportunity for everyone at Microsoft to have a single repository of words, expressions and abbreviations, easy to maintain and to which all content writers can refer.

**At the moment, we are looking for content authors who can help grow the number of topics. Here are some topics that we need help for:**

- .NET / .NET Core
- Application Insights
- ARM
- ARM Template
- Bash
- Blazor
- CDN
- CLI
- Codespace
- Compliance
- Connector
- CORS
- Device twin
- DevOps

[If you see a topic that you can help create, please fill this form](http://gslb.ch/gloss-new). You will get instructions per email and I will coach you through the process.

Thank you!
